            <p><strong>Tuscon, Arizona</strong> is a place filled with history, culture, and beautiful mountain views. Surrounded by national parks, Tucson is the place to go for desert views. Arizona is home to the Sonoran Desert, which is the only place in the world where you will find the famous Saguaro cacti.</p>
            <p>Saguaros became known and associated with old Western films, thanks to <em>Old Tucson Studios</em>, where many Western movies were filmed, including a number of John Wayne films. Old Tucson Studios remains to this day the same as it was in its peak film life. You can experience the old jail, saloons with live music shows and can-can girls, and even a live gunfight.</p>
            <p>With it's city limits resting just under 70 miles from the Mexican boarder, Tucson's culture is heavily influenced by both Mexican and Native American cultures. The city prides itself for being a melting-pot of culture, from the art and arcitecture found around the city to the local cuisine. The people of Tucson pride themselves on the history of their state and welcome those of all cultures to come and be a part of the southern culture.</p>
            <p>When in Tucson, you will not find a simple flower garden filled with roses and tulips. Instead, flower gardens consist of cacti in bloom and the various other desert plants. You will not find much diversity in color, but the cacti flowers will have you in awe. If you are lucky, when you are downtown, you will get to witness an authentic Mariachi band celebrating the day with their cheery music, or witness the stunning display of a family celebrating their daughter's quincea&ntilde;era.</p>
