            <p>Traveling is a great way to gain new experiences and learn about different cultures. In the United States, we are lucky enough to have a wide variety of culture to experience. From the country's national parks, to the trails that span either coastline, and even the country, America has something for everyone. From the Great Plains to the Grand Canyon, there is an activity or scenery for anyone and everyone.</p>
            <p>The Midwest is known for their wide variety of greenery and wildlife. You can find a plethora of dairy products to consume and farm animals to befriend. The <em>Midwest Nice</em> takes a new life once you experience the Northern hospitality of the American Midwest. You can choose between the city life of Chicago and Milwaukee or travel to the Wisconsin Northwoods for a more immersive nature experience.</p>
            <p>If you head to the Pacific Northwest, you will find heavily wooded areas with picturesque valley scenes. You will be transported to another world of peaceful nature when you step away from your every day life and head to the Cascade Range. If the hustle and bustle of the city is more your speed, look no further than the city life found in Portland or Seattle. Have dinner atop the Needle and look down out amongst all of the city lights, making all of your problems seem that much smaller in the world.</p>
            <p>A completely different experience is Southern America. Only in the south will you find the cacti-filled deserts with temperatures reaching up to 130&deg;F, but don't worry, "it's a dry heat." If you can withstand the heat, you will be rewareded with some of the most beautiful sunsets. With cities few and far between, you will see the sunsets fall upon the mountains, turning them shades of pink and orange, followed by a sky filled with stars that most parts of the country only dream about.</p>
            <p>Wherever your next vacation around the country takes you, make it a memerable one. There is beauty to be found everywhere, so keep your eyes open and experience all the United States has to offer.</p>
